quick recap on the actions

Note Day 2 : 
Git != Github
Git - -keep track of the changes in the project 
Repository 
Basically a folder that git keep track of 
It can be anything , text file , picture or source code 
where is all tracking happening inside the repo 
.git folder is where all tracking stored 
GitHub Desktop 
Git client tool to make it easy to work with git locally , visually 
and easily share project to GitHub.com 
Location : 
     Working directory|copy|tree 
     Staging area    a special area to prepare the changes before commit
     Local Repository  .git folder that track all information
     Remote Repository  repository in GitHub.com 
Commit : 
    a snapshot of changes you are tracking into local repository 
    for examle : you created new file and committed now its tracked 
               you edited the file commited and the changes are tracked 
    it has few component 
       The committers name :  B20-user
       Commit message : the message to describe what has changed 
       SHA (Simple Hashing Algorithm.) :

How to go from local repository to remote repository 
        First we need to have the remote repository
        then we need to build a connection 
        and eventually push local changes to remote 
    However GitHub Desktop does all 3 steps in one shot
